"As part of the API change regarding intents, Discord also changed how "

" 75 guilds at once and only request members from guilds that have the "
":attr:`Guild.large` attribute set to ``True``. With the new intent "

"The first solution is to request the privileged presences intent along "

"gateway. Note that we're still limited to 1 guild per request but the "
"number of guilds we request is significantly reduced."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intents.rst:182
msgid ""
"The second solution is to disable member chunking by setting "
"``chunk_guilds_at_startup`` to ``False`` when constructing a client. "
"Then, when chunking for a guild is necessary you can use the various "
"techniques to :ref:`retrieve members <retrieving_members>`."

"To illustrate the slowdown caused the API change, take a bot who is in "
"840 guilds and 95 of these guilds are \"large\" (over 250 members)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intents.rst:186
msgid ""
"Under the original system this would result in 2 requests to fetch the "
"member list (75 guilds, 20 guilds) roughly taking 60 seconds. With "
":attr:`Intents.members` but not :attr:`Intents.presences` this requires "
"840 requests, with a rate limit of 120 requests per 60 seconds means that"
" due to waiting for the rate limit it totals to around 7 minutes of "
"waiting for the rate limit to fetch all the members. With both "
":attr:`Intents.members` and :attr:`Intents.presences` we mostly get the "
"old behaviour so we're only required to request for the 95 guilds that "
"are large, this is slightly less than our rate limit so it's close to the"
